## ✨ Components

### 🟦 ZA Remap VRChat Collider
A tool to remap avatar descriptor colliders to target bones and define custom shapes for them. 

**Example Use cases:**  
- Making a modular prefab for setting up your standard humanoid Colliders.
- Reassigning colliders for weapon/props to interact with PhysBones. (Melee, guns, ect)
- Moving the hand collider to the head, allowing biting by holding trigger.
  - (Example Prefab soon™ toggle supported)

---

### 🟦 ZA Set View Position
A component to set the avatar descriptor view position based on the position of a GameObject in the world.  
- Works best as a child of a GameObject with `MA Bone Proxy` targeting the head.
  - (Example Prefab soon™)
- Great for non-destructivly setting the viewball with a prefab setup.
  - (Heels change your height? Auto move viewball)
